# Tic-Tac-Toe-SFML
This C++ project is a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game using the SFML library. The game supports two players, allows for tracking game statistics (wins, losses, and draws), and features a simple UI with options to reset the game board. The program also hides the console window during gameplay for a cleaner user experience.
